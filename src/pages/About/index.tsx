        Portraiture, above all other genres of art, was always my favourite. I consider my own work
        as illustrative rather than creative. What compels me is the desire to call attention to the
        essence of a living being; to relationships, particularly those between people and their
        pets and between animals; to emotions, feelings and any narrative objects that have those
        ingredients attached to them. All of these are contributory factors to the vitality of my
        portraits.

      <h2>Photographs and Artistry</h2>
      <p>
        In an ideal world, time does not matter. It would be lovely to forget about photos and
        simply paint portraits with the subjects sitting in front of me. However, very few people
        have the time to sit for a portrait and if they did, they would have to pay an awful lot
        more for the completed painting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Children and animals do not and will not sit still for hours daily, whilst someone paints
        their portrait. Moreover, what do you do if you want a portrait of a relative, friend or pet
        that has passed away?
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I produce portraits using photos and videos as references to work from, this does
        not mean ‘just copying’ a photograph. There is little point in merely reproducing a photo,
        which could simply be enlarged and giclée printed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a life form present in real time, photos are necessary reference tools for
        portraiture. Knowledge of anatomy and skin, hair, colour, hues, tones, light and shade,
        perspective, observational skills and the ability to draw freehand, are all still required
        to create a realist portrait. A straight reproduction can be flat and lifeless. Taking a
        snapshot of a person or an animal may capture a second in time but it does not capture the
        essence of the person or animal.
      </p>

        One question / comment I often hear is,”How do you manage to work so fast?” or “Wow, that
        was quick! I can’t believe you’ve done that!” This tells you something about my innate
        artistic ability. A natural artist (whether they are 'trained' or not) can work much quicker
        than one who is essentially a copyist. I did not train as an artist. I do not have a Fine
        Art degree.
      </p>

        However, I can and always have been able to draw; something that many art graduates cannot
        do. I understand that this may be because for many years now, much art ‘education’ has not
        focused on Anatomy, Life Drawing or any other kind of ‘drawing’ with a pencil and sketchpad
        before allowing students through the doors of colour, paint and imagination. Apparently,
        some art schools have omitted the fundamentals of drawing from the curriculum entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of ‘trained artists’ and art graduates around who can throw a bucket of paint
        at a canvas and call it art but who would be lost if you gave them a pencil and a sketchpad
        and asked them to draw a likeness of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using photos for reference also means it is possible to combine several different subjects
        into one composition. For example, you may want a portrait of your dog together with a
        couple of your previous pets who are no longer with you - but you have no photos of them all
        together. Or perhaps one of them may have had a very special toy he/she loved but you do not
        have a photo of your beloved deceased pet with that toy. I can create those for you – in
        portraits to treasure.
